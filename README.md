## Overview

The ArchViz Explorer Tool is an Unreal Engine-based application designed to assist users in designing and visualizing construction projects. This tool allows users to create roads, buildings, and interiors with a user-friendly interface and real-time visualization.

## Features

### 1. Road Construction
- **Functionality**: Users can construct roads by selecting two points on the terrain. The tool generates a road segment connecting these points.
- **User Interface**: A UI component allows users to enter road construction mode and place the start and end points of the road.
- **Visualization**: Roads are visualized in real-time with options to adjust width and material.

### 2. Building Creation
#### Templates/Load 
- Users can select from a list of predefined building templates or their own Saved one.
#### Custom Construction
- Users can place walls, doors, floors, and roofs individually to create custom buildings.
- UI options allow selection of different building components for placement in the world.
- Components snap together and align correctly to form a coherent structure.
